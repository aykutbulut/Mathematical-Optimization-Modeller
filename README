This package helps building mathematical optimization models. It will keep
track of variables and assigned indices. It aims to help the user when using
C++ interface for any kind of mathematical optimization solver.

Modeller does not aim to provide an environment like AMPL and GAMS. It is
just a helper when using C++ interface of solvers, like COIN-OR OSI.
Check examples for help.
